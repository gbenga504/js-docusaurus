## Philosophy

A proper documented application brings joy and increases the confidence of a team however code documentation still remains one of the toughest issues to tackle today.

- Most code bases are either not properly documented or not documented at all.
- Engineers frequently complain of the stress it takes to maintain a good docs.
- Code documentation for js apps have not been properly subdued to a certain phycology.

This extension is an attempt to ease the pain of documenting apps via an opinionated approach.
